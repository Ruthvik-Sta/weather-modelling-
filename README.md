# Weather Quadratic Modeling

This project demonstrates how quadratic equations are used in weather modeling via progressive stages:

- **Stage 1**: Hardcoded inputs
- **Stage 2**: Keyboard inputs
- **Stage 3**: Single set from file
- **Stage 4**: Multiple sets from file

Each stage includes basic error handling and outputs the roots of the equation.
